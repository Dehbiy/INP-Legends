# Late again, I see. Well, since you've graced us with your presence, let's put your skills to the test.

# Your challenge, should you choose to accept it (though I highly doubt you'll succeed), is to write a function that returns a simple greeting: 'Hello, World!'

# Pay attention now. I'll only explain this once. Write a function named 'return_hello_world'. It should take no arguments.

# Is that clear for you ?

def return_hello_world():
    '''Don't forget that the function should return "Hello, World!" '''

    # Don't make any careless mistakes. I'll be watching your every move.
    greeting = ""

    # Once you've crafted the greeting, return it from the function. I won't tolerate any sloppiness.
    return greeting


# Now, get to work. And remember, failure is not an option. Though, in your case, it seems to be a recurring theme.
